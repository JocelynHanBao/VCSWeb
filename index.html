                Can you please introduce yourself?<br><br><br>
                I am Azra. I am from India and I did my undergrade at the autumn school Chicago and zero communication
                concern, I've been working in India for the past five years I worked as a graphic designer director.
                That's my background.

        <div class="mian-text-show">
            <div class="main-left">
                I was wondering where your most impressive <br> interface design came from? A website, APP, <br> or mini
                program?
            </div>
            <div class="main-right">
                So an interface that come into my mind at one point of time, was actually, the sales scanner. I was
                honestly just thinking about interfaces in general. I don't know what you think of like iphone is, I was
                just thinking about things like the ipod that we used to use like the iconic sort of interfaces that.
                Have shaped our lives, good one that, something that I I found very different with this one like
                basically just self checkout counters. And that goes restored in America. So that's not something that
                we have back in. They are like this concept doesn't even exist. Right?
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="main-image">
            <img src="./images/image1.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="main-details_title">
            I found that pretty just like <br> something that stuck in my mind.
        </div>
        <div class="mian-text-show">
            <div class="main-left">
                In what context do you remember using this interface?
            </div>
            <div class="main-right">
                The first time I came to the U.S. for my undergrade. I remember kind of having interacted with like I
                said, check out counter, and it was a bit of a I guess you could call it a bit of a country shop,
                because I just wasn't sure how it. What's interesting like in India, like the most part you have, is no
                store would ever trust or self check out counter, it's so easy to pick up things. So the concept really
                did like blow my mind out here, because there is a certain level of trust in world, one both in
                technology and in the U.S., which I think is pretty interesting.
            </div>
            <div class="main-left top_70">
                What did it feel like to use it?
            </div>
            <div class="main-right">
                And I just like when I first used it. I remember because it just wouldn't work, and you kept having to
                call a guy, and I guess, the point of this you know when you need that human connection any way that you
                need somebody to come and override things. But more recently, now that I've moved back here, there's one
                this the set checkout center. It works and I've already like enjoy going there and checking.
            </div>
            <div class="main-left top_70">
                What do you find most interesting about it?
            </div>
            <div class="main-right">
                I don't know like the concept in general is pretty interesting. Like checking out that group, Cashier,
                the bar code is out of those restored like that is the flexible app one point of time for software
                machina, it's pretty simple, like technology, being able to scan a qr code. I don't have to follow
                outcomes or whatever, though little code, which is the simplicity of it.
            </div>

        <div class="mian-text-show">
            <div class="main-left">
                I know you're a designer, so is there anything that <br> you don't feel comfortable using as a designer,
                or <br> that you suggest could be improved?
            </div>
            <div class="main-right">
                What do you actually see when you see your things being loaded, you know, when you need to be things
                when you need to like, when you when you want to try to skip back like skip? But even. The payment
                process, all of that, like the visuals of them, are pretty outdated, like the age of technology, that we
                didn't and the kind of or interfere design that even that exists design that is definitely not
                translated and more like I like interfaces or machinery that we interact with also on a daily basis, for
                example, with the mta, the subways, or all of these things like the kind of box design in the kind of
                visual that you see, on interfaces I got a pretty outdated right like just raw purely, from the design
                perspective, so as a design, I feel like there's something I can be up like improved over, and it comes
                to yeah designing so interfaces that are beyond our phones and our screens.
            </div>

        <div class="mian-text-show">
            <div class="main-left">
                What else comes to mind when you think of it?
            </div>
            <div class="main-right">
                Honestly, like it's sometimes very sensitive. I think I've already mentioned this before, but there is a
                kind of like child like excitement, like using a scanner There's just something really fun about it
                which is which might sound really sad, Yeah, I think that sounds great yeah, just just exciting. About
                us, buying things like scanning those items.
            </div>
            <div class="main-left top_70">
                Do you think it's will exist for a long time? Are there any prospects?
            </div>
            <div class="main-right">
                For example, with Amazon right I'm runshop and go like to enter the store, you don't check out either
                anything. You just enter the store. You click up your ids, you walk out the store, and it's directly
                like whatever you've taken without having to like touch any anything, without having to see anything
                anyone or whatever like. You just put it on your tab right on your Amazon tab. So I mean, I don't think
                so. Like the machine is going to stay the same, but the idea has been to the deck was always going to be
                a custom one. Like somebody who hopes like you know, like there's always going to be the that
                transaction happening always. So it's just I feel like the implications is going to take shape around.
